Requirements for the functionality of webReader for Moodle and docReader are outlined in the specification documentation for respective products whne you purchase a license.

For docReader it is important to note that since the functionality for the product relies on the docReader server fetching and parsing documents, the Moodle platform used must be publically available to the docReader server and there is no firewall or other measurement preventing the docReader proxy component (located in the plugin) for making a request towards the Moodle platform in order to retrieve the document and return it to the docReader server.

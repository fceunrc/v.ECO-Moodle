# Register Moodle with Azure using Windows PowerShell

This PowerShell Script provisions a new Azure application for your Microsoft 365 tenant, which will be used by the [Microsoft 365 Moodle Plugin](https://github.com/Microsoft/o365-moodle/). The script will provision the app for your O365 tenant, set up all the required Reply URLs and Permissions for the provisioned app and return the AppID and Key. You can use the generated AppID and Key in your O365 Moodle Plugin Setup Page to configure your Moodle server with Azure AD.
